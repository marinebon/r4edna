## Objectives

Even if you haven't coded in R before, going to try to acquaint you with some new, cool data science techniques. From zero to data science hero!

## Motivating example: eDNA Shiny app

**Shiny** is an R package and framework for building interactive applications. It provides a set of functions for building a front end web interface (into a file `ui.R`) that gets updated based on a back end set of R custom rendering functions (`server.R`). Shiny represents the end point, or motivating use case, for today. Here's an example of a Shiny app for environmental DNA (eDNA) data:

Here's the code for this app:

Note that the app is hosted at [**Github.com**](https://github.com), _the_ online versioning portal where the open source world collaboratively codes. As is this little tutorial:

, which is rendered in **Rmarkdown**.
